This course provides a deep dive into automation testing, covering essential tools and frameworks like Selenium, Java, TestNG, and CI/CD integration. The instructors are knowledgeable, hands-on, and always ready to clarify concepts with real-world examples.

What stands out the most is the structured approach to learningâ€”starting from the fundamentals and gradually progressing to advanced topics. The practical assignments and real-world projects make a huge difference in reinforcing my understanding of automation.

If you're looking to step into automation testing or level up your QA skills, I highly recommend Cloudberryâ€™s QA Automation course! ðŸ’¡ðŸ’»
